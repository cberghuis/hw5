### Path Forward? (17 Nov, Grafton)
_I feel like most of this is done, we just need to figure out the h(n) loop. Iterative loops are not my fort√©, so a second pair of eyes is appreciated. If it looks good to you but still doesn't work, we probably need to get it in front of Dr. Richards in a way he can't dismiss._
1. Finish h(n) loop.
2. Sniff test on output: f(n) outputs as expected; other two are odd.
3. Complete summary Word document.
